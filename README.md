# Preech_ScrollFish

A Warcraft addon that casts fishing on scroll up or down when you have a pole 
equipped.

If you're wearing [Nat's Hat](http://www.wowhead.com/item=88710/nats-hat), it'll keep your pole buffed.

If you're on the [Anglers Fishing Raft](http://www.wowhead.com/item=85500/anglers-fishing-raft), it'll keep the buff up.
